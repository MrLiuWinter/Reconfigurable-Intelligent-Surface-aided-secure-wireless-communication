# Train a robot arm from scratch

* [Part 1](/part1/): built a training framework
* [Part 2](/part2/): Learn to build a environment from scratch
* [Part 3](/part3/): Complete the basic environment script, see how arm moves
* [Part 4](/part4/): Plug a Reinforcement Learning method and try to train it
* [Part 5](/part5/): Optimize and debug it
* [Final](/final/): Make a moving goal
