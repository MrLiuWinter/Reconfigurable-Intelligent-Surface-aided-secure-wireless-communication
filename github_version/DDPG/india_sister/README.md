# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Intelligent-reflecting-Surfaces

Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs): A Promising Technology for 6G Networks:
In this work, we examine a downlink MISO scenario with an intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) to maximise the SNR for the user. The IRS optimization problem
is complex and non-convex because it necessitates the tuning of the phase shift
reflection matrix with unit modulus constraints. We use deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) to forecast and optimally adjust the IRS phase shift matrices, owing to the
increasing use of DRL approaches capable of tackling non-convex optimization
problems. The Deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm in [1] has been
studied and implemented in Python from the scratch. Te IRS-assisted MISO system
based on the DRL scheme produces a high SNR, according to implementation and
simulation results. Furthermore, we modify the IRS-DRL framework to account for
unknown channel gains between IRS and user, which would occur in practice because
IRS is uninformed of the userâ€™s position and cannot forecast the angles of departures,
as required by the assumed Rician Channel fading model.
